            Aro is so much more than an app and box for you phone. It’s about
            what happens once you put down your phone. Aro lets parents and kids
            connect by creating an environment where phones aren't a
            distraction.

            phone, shows you data to improve your phone habits, and even lets

              the distraction of your phone.
